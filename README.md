A PyTorch implementation of DeepMinds 2021 ICCV Paper Broaden Your Views for Self-Supervised Video Learning

This repository contains a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of the paper  
[Broaden Your Views for Self-Supervised Video Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16559)  
as presented by [Deepmind](https://www.deepmind.com) in their 2021 ICCV Paper.  
The original [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io) implementation can be found [In the official Repository](https://github.com/deepmind/brave).  

We will reimplement the original paper, aswell as provide additional experimental features based on the needs of our current project in self-supervised learning for MRI data. 

We will provide scripts to reproduce most experiments in the paper, but we cannot promise to provide pretrained models, as the training may end up too expensive for our current team.
